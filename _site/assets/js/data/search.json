    "snippet": "Thoughts-I listened to a podcast of “L’heure philo” and they’re like walking is good for thinking and most Greek philosophs were doing it inattentivally and they don’t mention it but they do it for a long time or hours, Nietzsche thinks that any idea should be out with a physical effort (I don’t know how to say it in english but i feel it, Actually any idea from Nietzsche I feel it rather than say it), I took this very fucking long journey of walking and staying alone and I’m grateful for it because I succeded to gather all my chaos and rethink  my ideas and my self, I give opinions and critics about life, my self, other people “I just wanted to lie in the grass and look at the clouds. ~Jack Kerouac (Book: Lonesome Traveler)”, I discovered new things I love to do, new dreams, new truths, I don’t belive in anything, especially religions but I believe in the beauty, the beauty of spirituality but I have a little understanding of psychology, is that spirituality  like music engender human emotions so it’s all about chemicals…Warning:Peace Be within you!

    "snippet": "This post is within a serie of my philosophical inspirations…Titles— A philosoph who refuses to be a considered as one. The great man of all timeWhy I love Nietzschethe reason I love Nietzsche (While I disagree with some of what he has to say), is because a philosopher’s power lies in the consistency of their voice. No other philosopher has so consistently, made me question the very foundations of my moral and personal beliefs. Nietzsche truly is one in a billion, his perspective is so unique, and so unusual that it almost warrants genius, if genius truly is “Hitting a target no one else can see”. His writing is also magical, which is rare for a philosopher. Specifically his work Thus spoke Zarathustra, has very poetic, and interesting exposition, and it’s shrouded in beautiful metaphorical imagery, which makes you work to actually find the true meaning of what he’s writing.  Some people get frustrated by how “flowery” his writing can seem, and I get that, but if you really give yourself time to think about what he’s saying you’ll find that every word is purposeful, and carefully considered.Peace Be within you!

The sky before sunrise is soaked with light. Rosy colour tints buildings, bridges, and the Seine. I was here when she with whom I walk wasn’t born yet, and the cities on a distant plain stood intact, before they rose in the air with the dust of sepulchral brick, and the people who lived there didn’t know. Only this moment, at dawn, is real to me. The bygone lives are like my own past life, uncertain. I cast a spell on the city, asking it to lastWarning:As this is my first post, thi blog is dedicated for my demons, my talks always in my head, they never stop, this is a journal, maybe nobody will ever read them, it’s a daily journal, I will post whenver the hell I feel like it, it’s about philosophy, music, poems, entertainement, and HACKING… Anything… and Nothing!This is modern age Phrack magazine but a dark one.Peace Be within you!
