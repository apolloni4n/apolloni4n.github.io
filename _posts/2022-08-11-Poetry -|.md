This post is within a serie of my poetic inspirations
## Titles
---If there is any God



## Love
I d just want u to know, crystallized FLOOD
How u were beautifully made by god
I believe he has taken every single moment to draw
You, As if he s gonna die tomorrow
With love and enthusiasm he made your eyes
And with an angelic voice he filled your throat
I hope with a whiter color than white itself he painted your soul
And hesitating between two moons to put in the sky
One as your face, he did sacrifice
And no doubt this face will be mine, till i run out of rhyme
Are u a a mandarinfish, or a dove
I truly ain t sure love
Writing this, im imagining every single feature of ur face
U just unbelievably, in my heart sculptured a timeless trace
So why won t u help me please, get this shit out of my lips
AND LET OUR MOUTHS BE ONE, CUZ M TOTALLY PERSUADED THEY RE BETTER THAN THE TASTE OF MY FUCKING CIGARETTES.

A moody UNKNOWN brain
