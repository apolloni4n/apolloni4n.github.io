# Why I love Nietzsche
the reason I love Nietzsche (While I disagree with some of what he has to say), is because a philosopher's power lies in the consistency of their voice. No other philosopher has so consistently, made me question the very foundations of my moral and personal beliefs. Nietzsche truly is one in a billion, his perspective is so unique, and so unusual that it almost warrants genius, if genius truly is "Hitting a target no one else can see". His writing is also magical, which is rare for a philosopher. Specifically his work Thus spoke Zarathustra, has very poetic, and interesting exposition, and it's shrouded in beautiful metaphorical imagery, which makes you work to actually find the true meaning of what he's writing.  Some people get frustrated by how "flowery" his writing can seem, and I get that, but if you really give yourself time to think about what he's saying you'll find that every word is purposeful, and carefully considered.
