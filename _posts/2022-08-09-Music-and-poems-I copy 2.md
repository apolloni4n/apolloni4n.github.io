## Thoughts
-I listened to a podcast of "L'heure philo" and they're like walking is good for thinking and most Greek philosophs were doing it unintentinally and they don't mention it but they do it for a long time or hours, Nietzsche thinks that any idea should be out with a physical effort (I don't know how to say it in english but i feel it, Actually any idea from Nietzsche I feel it rather than say it), I took this very fucking long journey of walking and staying alone and I'm grateful for it because I succeded to gather all my chaos and rethink  my ideas and my self, I give opinions and critics about life, my self, other people "I just wanted to lie in the grass and look at the clouds. ~Jack Kerouac (Book: Lonesome Traveler)", I discovered new things I love to do, new dreams, new truths, I don't belive in anything, especially religions but I believe in the beauty, the beauty of spirituality but I have a little understanding of psychology, is that spirituality  like music engender human emotions so it's all about chemicals...
